For information on the available settings that are configurable please have a look at the standalone repository: https://github.com/danielperna84/hass-configurator/blob/master/README.md  
Some settings mentioned there are not useful in the add-on though.  
All required dependencies (git and pyotp for the `SESAME_TOTP_SECRET` feature) are of course included when building this add-on.  
This add-on will be built live on your Hass.io machine when installing it. So it may take some time, depending on the performance of your machine.
